# oop_final_project

The oop_final_project.zip is the full running Java file that contains every function needed to satisfy the requirement of the proposal. This financial investment tracking system allow user to type in the details of their stock market performance manually by day, and keep track of the overall performance.

Here is a brief go over of all the files this zip file contains.

System Generated Files:
1. data.txt: this file keeps track of the date.
2. incomes.csv: this file gives the initial Salary information of the user.
3. stocks.csv: this file keeps track of all the stock transaction made.

lib file: jar file used to plot the graph.

src file: this is where all the codes are, by opening src file, there is a package named tracer, opening up this package is a file named MainFrame.java, this is the main file for this system, running this file opens up the system. There are also 2 sub-files in this package, model and UI. While the model file gives all the functions, the UI files are the designs of the frame windows. 

Here is a brief introduction for the system's functions. As you open the system, you should see the following tabs:
1. Income: this gives a track of your income, if you have an income today, you can record it here, in default, I had already added a Salary of $1220 in Day0.
2. Stock: this allows you to track the investments you made in the stock market, you can record the stock you brought or sold, along with the amount and the price of the action you made. You can either add a transaction or delete one. I had added some sample stocks before Day2.
3. Asset: This contains 2 graphs, giving you an overall idea of the investment distribution of your and your assets distribution.
4. Investment: Simulates the investment performance you made during a period of time by your own selection. This is only a simulation.
5. Next Day: Moving to the next day for you to record.
6. Set Date: Allows you to go back to a date you prefer.

This file had been tested multiple times, to insure best experience, the default initial run of the file starts at Day2, where deals had been made on Day0 and Day1 already, so user had checkout his/her total asset distribution and investment performance already.
